# Netflix Clone



This project is a simplified front end clone of Netflix. It was created only with HTML, CSS and Owl (Grid and Flexbox) at the https://web.digitalinnovation.one one bootcamp with the instructor Feliepe Aguiar. It uses [The MovieDB Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to search for movies and display details. Feel free to contribute!
